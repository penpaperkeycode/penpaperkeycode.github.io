> “Experience feeds us, opportunity grows us, relationships inspire us, and the world shapes us.”

I am an experimental scientist in Artificial Intelligence, focused on pushing the limits of efficiency—from efficiency-aware pre-training schemes and algorithmic sparsity to state-of-the-art model compression—so that AI can deliver measurable, positive impact for society. Guided by rigorous empirical methodology and an appetite for interdisciplinary collaboration, I aim to translate cutting-edge research into deployable systems that make the best use of every flops, byte, and human interaction.

In a life lived only once, I am committed to building a career I will look back on without regret—one defined by curiosity, integrity, and lasting contribution.
